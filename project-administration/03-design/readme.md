#  FEEDBACK

- add reference number to project risk list item
- it would be good to have an overview of the architecture, type of applicaton etc., show diagram before technical descriptions..
- package diagram showing dependencies missing, name packages/modules explicitly in the onion description
- describe which dependencies should be enforced/discouraged
- security not mentioned...
- class diagram should mention it only consists of core module classes
- class responsibility is placed weirdly at the end
- overall responsibility too general, what is a user? a student, who wants to share documents...
- class descrition? responsibility here
- interaction diagram: document which patterns are use (information expert...)
- browse communication diagram: what is a document controller... grasp controller? NOO => backend controller/rest endpoint
